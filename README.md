# rubiks-gesture-sim
A computer vision playground using OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures and map them to Rubik’s Cube movements. The goal is to simulate cube rotations with intuitive gestures captured from a webcam. Current version focuses on webcam feed and overlay — gesture logic is work-in-progress for learning purposes.
